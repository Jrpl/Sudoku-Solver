All of the *.sudoku files are valid starting states.

A filename formatted as YYYYMMDD[abc].sudoku is taken from NYT on that date, with a being the easy, b the medium, and c the hard puzzle.

The code in `scrape.js` can be pasted as-is into the browser console when viewing a NYT sudoku in order to get the condensed text format version of the puzzle (which can then be used as the content of a .sudoku file).
